# toki li pona. toki ni li lukin.

1. Perspective

# Perspective
A big factor that plays in toki pona philosophy is perspective.
What is, is. It is because the speaker observes it so, and says it is.

A car in a passenger's perspective can be a moving indoor space.
A moving indoor space in toki pona would be *tomo tawa*.
A car in a driver's perspective can be a tool for going.
A tool for going in toki pona would be *ilo tawa*.

This is a common philosophy applied and taught in toki pona which can also be found in lipu pu.
I would like to implement another approach to further expand perception.
