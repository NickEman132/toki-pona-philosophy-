# toki pona philosophy by jan Nikola

1. Perspective

# Perspective
A big factor that plays in toki pona philosophy is perspective.
What is, is. It is because the speaker observes it so, and says it is.
A car in a passenger's perspective can be a moving indoor space.
A moving indoor space in toki pona would be *tomo tawa*.
A car in a driver's perspective can be a tool for going.
A tool for going in toki pona would be *ilo tawa*.
